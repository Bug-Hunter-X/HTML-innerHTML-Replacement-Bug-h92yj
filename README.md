# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to using `innerHTML` in HTML to replace existing content within a div element.  The bug occurs due to incorrect implementation; the intended new content does not correctly replace the old content.

## Bug Description:
The original HTML code attempts to replace the text within a div element using `innerHTML`. However, it does so incorrectly, resulting in the original content disappearing without the new text being displayed. This is subtle, and the issue is not immediately apparent.

## Bug Solution:
The solution corrects the code by ensuring the correct syntax for using `innerHTML` to update the div's content. The corrected `innerHTML` assignment properly replaces the original content.
